# pythonScript:
---------------

 Condverting audio or vedio content to text formate.
  I am very exited to share my first pythonScript is coverting the audio or vedio content to text or json formate. In that I have learn how to handle the packages when conflicts has arrived. it was very exited to 
  solve the probles.
--> First in our ide we need install the required packages of the pythonScript
   i.e 1. Whisper
       2. ffmpeg
       3. Json5
       4. Pathlib
       5. Subprocess
-->  After install  all the packages now we need import the module ffmpeg to access the audio and vedio of they media file with their extensions .mp3, .mp4, .wav,etc..

-->  After setting the ffmpeg module we need to configure in our local system also for this we need to downloadd the ffmpeg from official website https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html. After completeing the download 
     we need to add the ffmpeg path manually in our main.py file.
     
--> After configur the ffmpeg in our local system and IDE then we can choose a audio or vedio from our local system or in cloud before selecting media files we need very care while giving the file path either it is 
    absolute path or relative path.
    
--> Then we ready to go for the execution of pythonScript.

--> IDE -- Pycharm, VsCode,etc.
